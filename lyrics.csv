Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,189,When other MCs hear me rappin' wishin' they could imitate
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,190,Because they don't have a style of they own
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,191,They listen very hard when I'm on the microphone
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,192,"They go up to my front, stare in my face"
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,193,While I'm rappin' on the mic at a steady pace
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,194,But it's alright if they're on my tip
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,195,'Cause I know damn well they can't rock this
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,196,So when the party's over and it's time to go home
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,197,They try to think of what I said on my microphone
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,198,"When they're sittin' down, tryin' to make up they own"
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,199,They find it very hard to leave mine alone
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,200,"'Cause my style is def, my words are threats"
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,201,I haven't met an MC that rocked me yet

Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,207,There is nothin' in the world that can tear us apart
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,208,We had determination to reach the top
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,209,We had love for the people who watched us rock
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,210,"Our purpose, (our reason) were all the same"
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,211,We said fame and fortune is what we claim
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,212,But hard times y'all were knockin' at the door
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,213,What we had from the start was there no more
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,214,They tried to slow us down to a halt
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,215,They told us to our face it was our fault
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,216,"They accused, misused and they tried to abuse"
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,217,The battles we fought we were bound to lose
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,218,So to be young men we had to take the loss
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,219,'Cause you got to pay the cost to be the boss
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,220,But now we're back and we're on the double
Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,Double Trouble,male,1983,Old School,Double Trouble At The Amphitheatre,221,Don't mess with us unless you're lookin' for trouble

I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,65,That finesse is knocking at my door
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,66,I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,67,And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,68,I bring the element H with the 2
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,69,So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,70,It's just mind over matter
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,71,And what matters is
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,72,That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,73,I keep the walking on the right side
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,74,But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,75,Cuz that's how he wants to be
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,76,"No difference, see"

I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,81,The pile of revenue I create
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,82,But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,83,The deeds of a natural
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,84,Are seeds that are no longer planted
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,85,So the famine in the mind is strong
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,86,Tactics of another plane is now proven sane
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,87,Sane enough to let you know from within this song

I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,91,And that is to bring the peace
I Am I Be,De La Soul,male,1993,Old School,I Am I Be,92,Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am
